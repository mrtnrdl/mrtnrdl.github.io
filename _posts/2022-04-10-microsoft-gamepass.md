i've just reactivated my ms gamepass. for 1 euro. we didn't use the stupid xbox for several months, so i've paused the subscription for a while - and again i got the 1euro/month price. this is amazing! since we bought the console, i've probably paid not even the price of a single game and played a ton of different titles. this is exactly how MS is winning the console market. 

the playstation might have *better* exclusives, the nintendo consoles might have the *more famous* characters, series etc - but the fact that i can play a ton of games, whenever i want, for almost free is why i'd never buy another console (steam deck aside, as i bought it for different reasons) besides one from MS. and i don't even like most of the things they do beside their consoles... this is something i wouldn't even have considered ten years ago. 

yet i stil remember the feeling when i played the first few hours of **HALO** back when i bought the original xbox. or the amazing feeling when i bought it in the store. the weight of the box, the moment when we sat in the car and drove home. the unboxing and the connection to the tv - this is one of the most intense memories from my early teens... sadly, i sold the thing a few years later with all my games when i needed a new monitor for my PC :( 

i really hope the steam deck will burn itself in my memory like this as well.
