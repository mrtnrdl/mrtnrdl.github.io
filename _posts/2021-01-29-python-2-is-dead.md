I'm currently working with python. I'm not the biggest fan of python - and this stems mostly from the annoyance that is python 2 and/or 3 confusion. Python 2 has been EOL since **January 1st 2020**. It is dead for *over one year* now. Okay, not that long - at least compared to the time, that it was possible to start a new project with python 2. Now even `pip` tells you, that python2 is eol and lots of libraries stopped to support it. 

I'm looking forward to say goodbye to python 2. Maybe I'll enjoy it a bit more, when it's finally burried. 

So if you think about starting a project in python and you have always used 2 until now - please don't. Just go with 3, even if it means you have to re-learn stuff. We all have to learn something new all the time anyways. Let the dead language rest. 

`python 3` all the way **\m/**
