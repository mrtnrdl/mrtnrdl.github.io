i've been trying to capture the last year for quite a while. i've also tried to sum it up in a few words for quite a while. so i sat here and stared at an empty editor window. cursor blinking. mind blank. i can't even say why, because everything went fine. all are healthy. the kids are growing - arguing, playing and laughing together. i also read and learned a lot. about me, about technology, security, productivity etc etc. maybe i'll write something about that stuff later. and probably book-by-book (or topic-wise) and not some single, big and bloated "recap" post. 


with that said - here's to a great 2023! i hope y'all had a good start and keep kicking ass <3
