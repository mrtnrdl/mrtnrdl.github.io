## new years resolutions for 2019

no review of 2018 - i rather look forward to 2019.
<!--more-->
what i've planned for 2019: 

- get the CEH
- get _fluent_ enough in `golang` to write (relatively) simple cli programs 
	- file system operations
	- network ops
	- data manipulation
- practice more photography. grab the camera kinda regularly and shoot 
- lose a few pounds, get used to working out (again) 
- finish my tattoo


that's it. nothing too much and nothing too fancy. wish me luck.
