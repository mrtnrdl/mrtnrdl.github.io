one of my goals for 2019 is to, for the lack of a better word, formalize my education in the information security space. to do that, i decided to obtain the CEH, also known as the *C*ertified *E*thical *H*acker certification. 

i decided to start with that certificate, because it covers a lot of ground and is well known in the industry. i might not be the certificate that offers you the highest _infosec street cred_ - but i don't care about that. i do this for me, because i want to learn. 

## prep

to get a grip on the materials required, i'm taking the [prep course on linuxacademy](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/239). 

## schedule 

i want to get certified some time in the first half of 2019. according to my estimation (and course schedule on the prep course) i should be able to finish the prep course until end of march - and as soon as i feel comfortable enough, i'll schedule the exam.
