It's been a while since i discovered and kinda fell in love with [obsidian](http://obsidian.md). As in [my last post about changing blog tech](https://blog.mrtnrdl.de/personal/2021/10/06/changing-blog-tech.html) already said, i'd love to use it as my blogging-solution as well. 

As I'd definately loose the rss feed of the blog, I've already cancelled the thought - but my mate [Markus](https://twitter.com/HashtagMarkus) faced the same problem and simply wrote a thing: [obsidian2hugo](https://github.com/HashtagMarkus/obsidian2hugo). I still need to test it for myself - and set up a web server etc before i do it - but then I'm good to go. 

It'll be a nice opportunity to change the style of the blog. :]
