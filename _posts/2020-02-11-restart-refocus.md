I think I've written a post like this on almost every blog i ever had - the first post after a long(er) radio silence. This will be a train of thought, without structure - so if you bare with me, feel free to continue reading. I don't mind if you, dear reader, skip this post. 

The last year has been quite the ride for me. I've fully transitioned to an infosec-role, got my first cert and learned a ton (thanks to everyone involved at hackthebox, the hack in the box conference, blackhat, defcon, the ccc and linux academy). Despite all that, i also became a father. This still feels weird to type and read...

Of course, this has introduced lots of new things in my life and shifted my priorities a bit. It also made me realize, how much time i spend glued to displays or with headphones in, consuming media, news, theories and knowledge. For example i was pretty proud being able to listen to an enormous amount of podcasts each week, due to the fact that i worked myself up to 2x listening speed. After a while i recognized, that this came at a cost - i couldn't remember shit about what has been said. But not only there, i also forgot way more shit that i used to. I've always been prone to forgetting something, that's why i made it a habit to write (almost) everything down that i _have_ to do, but i took notice. Not being able to complete my backlog of podcasts also introduced unnecessary stress to my life, so i decided i need to get rid of that as well. 
I did a considerable downsizing of my podcasts and reduced the listening speed to 1x. Speaking about focus: Everything purely _development_ related got kicked out - it's too much to keep up with this as well as the cybers. I also unsubscribed from some very long and "talkey" podcasts, as it does not contribute to my focus and therefore distracts me from achieving my goals.  

After a few weeks i already noticed an improved focus and i don't miss anything. The important stuff always reaches you. Feel free to drastically reduce your intake of _news_ etc. This also forces you to *focus* more. What is important and what is not? With that in mind, I decided to (finally) finish what i started last year - my [eCPPT Certification](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ecppt/). I did not manage to finish that in time for the birth of my little one, so i decided to start over. Back to square one and study! 

To get myself into the groove, I started doing hackthebox again - already got three users, two roots and solved one challenge. FeelsGoodMan!

When this is done, I want to dive in one of the three big cloud providers and learn about building stuff there in a secure way - and probably about pwning it as well! I haven't decided yet, if it'll be azure, aws or gcp - time will tell. I'm leaning a bit towards azure, as it seems to be extremely in demand right now...

Guess it'll be a busy year - I'll try to do updates from time to time and will drop stuff i learn on the way right here. 

cu soon and have a great year 2020!
