A few days ago, someone asked me if i learnt certain stuff in school - which i didn't. For them, it seemed to be totally crazy to keep on learning new stuff after you finish school, university or apprenticeship etc. 

That's honestly very confusing for me. Imagine you stopped to develop when you left school! At that point I was, for the lack of a better word, a dumb asshole. I knew **jack shit** about anything that would actually be useful in live. I had no idea what i wanted in life or how i wanted to live it. 

And I'm pretty sure - and even hope - that i'll be thinking the same about my 30s in 10-15 years. Is there a point where learning ever stops? There is probably always something new or interesting to explore. Let's keep doint that!
