last week during shopping, i've stumbled upon something i have not seen in years: a perry rhodan dime novel. i've started reading these novels when i started to explore science fiction 20 years ago. i started with number 1, and now i just finished _2999_ - and with number _3000_, a new story arch begins. 

this brought up so many memories. i've spent many hours, days, nights with perry, bully, [gucky](https://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Gucky) and many others. looking forward for the next series, and i hope the stories stay as captivating as they were before. 

i also learnt, that you can buy *all* of the old episodes as ebooks in the [shop](https://perry-rhodan.net/). the future is now!
